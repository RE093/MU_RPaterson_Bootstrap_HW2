MU Coding Bootcamp Homework Assignment 2 - Bootstrap Website

## Boostrap Web Portfolio

This is a portfolio created using a bootstrap framework. 
- The site has three pages, 'About Me', 'Portfolio' and Contact. 
- They all share a common navigation bar, footer and CSS to make the pages widths and responsiveness on different size windows the same. 
- The pages also have another CSS to change their styling, and for now they are on the same page, later on, if more content and CSS is added I would Individually assign a styling file to each HTML page.
- The Images are responsive, proportionately to container and text.
- I have tried to minimise the use of media screens but decided to use one or two in the master CSS.
- For the most part the site utilises the bootstrap grid system, with a couple of my own changes thrown in to make it more how I want it. 
- On the 'xs' screen the page width takes up the whole screen and then on 'sm' and larger screens their is a margin on the right and left sides of the screen. 
- All HTML files were checked using the W3 validation service.
